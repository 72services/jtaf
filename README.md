## Background
The Turnverein Erlach organizes different evnts for children and young people for years.
First these events were accomplished by hand, starting from 1997 with Excel and starting from 1999 with an Access solution.
2005 JTAF was created as in Java usig the Eclipse rich client platform and was made open source.
And 2013 I decided to move JTAF to the web using HTML5!
